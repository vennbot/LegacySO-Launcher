## Prerequisites for Development

- Latest Node.js LTS on a Windows, macOS, or Ubuntu machine.

## Running the Launcher Locally

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `app` folder.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm run start`.

## Building the Launcher

After cloning and running `npm install`, build the launcher by following the steps below:

- **For Windows**: In the `app` folder, run `npm run buildwin`.
- **For macOS**: In the `app` folder, run `npm run builddarwin`.
- **For Linux**: In the `app` folder, run `npm run builddeb`.

Built binaries are generated in the `release` folder (`FreeSO Launcher.dmg` for macOS, `FreeSO Launcher Setup.exe` for Windows, and `FreeSO Launcher.deb` for Linux).

Notes on building for multiple platforms:
* If you're using a macOS machine for development, you can generate builds for both macOS and Windows using the commands above. You need to have [wine](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/wine-stable) installed before running `npm run buildwin`.
* If you're using a Windows machine for development, you can only generate builds for Windows via `npm run buildwin`. This is due to the .dmg creation process during macOS builds, which is incompatible with Windows systems.
* To build the launcher for Linux via `npm run builddeb`, you need to be on a macOS or Linux machine.

## Latest Releases

Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/ItsSim/lsolauncher/releases) to download the latest version of FreeSO Launcher for Windows, macOS, or Linux.

## Linux Support

We currently support 64-bit Debian-based distros, like Ubuntu.

From version 1.12.x onwards, a .deb package is included in the [release assets](https://github.com/ItsSim/lsolauncher/releases).

## Dropped Support for Windows 7/8/8.1 and macOS < 10.15

As of launcher version 1.11.x and onward, we no longer support:
* macOS versions < 10.15 (Catalina)
* Windows 7, 8, and 8.1.

Users of these operating systems will need to remain on launcher version 1.10.x or earlier. You can find the last 1.10.x release [here](https://github.com/ItsSim/lsolauncher/releases/tag/1.10.4-prod.2).

This change follows the discontinuation of support for these versions by Electron (and Chromium also) starting with Electron 23. For further details, please refer to [this informative article](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/windows-7-to-8-1-deprecation-notice) on the Electron blog.
