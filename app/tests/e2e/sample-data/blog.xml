Despite the allure of this premise, the game hasn’t garnered the millions of players it deserves. Why?</p><p>We played GTA Online for five seconds and immediately understood the problem. You can’t <em>feel</em> like you’re committing hundreds of crimes a minute from a third person view. “Be somebody. Else.”? More like, <em>watch</em> somebody else enjoy a ball pit hot tub in an extravagant mcmansion. That should be YOU!!!</p><p>Starting TODAY, you can control your sims directly. No need for pesky “go here” interactions, taking boring fast straight lines to where you want to go. Take the longest path you want, run in circles, this is TRUE freedom. Everyone else will be able to see EXACTLY what you are looking at, with 32-bit floating point precision. Tell them how you feel to their (virtual) face. It’s like you’re living a Second Life, and it’s never been done before.</p><h2>Instructions:</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Press TAB to switch into first person view. Use WASD or the arrow keys to move, and the mouse to look around. Click on objects as usual to open the pie menu. Hold shift to sprint. Press backspace to cancel the active interaction. Press Escape to release the mouse, though opening a pie menu, dialog or chat will also do this. Click on the game to refocus mouse controls.</p><p><em>Note: You must use 3D mode to experience First Person Direct Control. Otherwise, you will just see everyone else having fun.</em></p><p>Soon, you might be WSAD’ing cars off the sheer drops around your flattened lots. You will be fighting to the death in a city spanning battle royale. You will be purchasing so many hats and gun skins that reality will lose its meaning, and you’ll be left living a cold husk of a life kept afloat by images generated by an unfeeling machine. Who knows where the future may take us?</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://freeso.org/first-person-sims-fps/">First Person Sims (FPS)</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://freeso.org">FreeSO</a>.</p>

				<![CDATA[<p>Today marks 20 years since The Sims Online was officially released.</p><p>On release, The Sims Online was pitched with the potential to become the biggest MMO in the world, right off of the massive success of The Sims. The deep simulation and interactions of the original, combined with the creativity of millions of players around the world. What the world expected was another smash hit success &#8211; video gaming taken by storm by the most ambitious entry in the series yet&#8230; but The Sims Online was not The Sims. The same base simulation, but a completely different game, it simply couldn&#8217;t capture the same audience. It was hard enough to understand why The Sims worked so well in the first place.</p><p>After just under 6 years, and an incredibly awkward attempt at a reboot, all cities were closed for good. Despite this, years of communities devoted to the game kept interest alive for almost a decade. That kind of following is hard to come by. I remember personally checking the <a href="http://niotso.org">http://niotso.org</a> blog religiously for months. After almost a decade of spinoff games trying to recapture the feeling, and many failed restoration projects, we finally emerged with something resebling the original game. Now, it&#8217;s scary to think that FreeSO&#8217;s servers have now been running for more days than it.</p><p>I don&#8217;t think the experience and feeling that this game provides has ever been replicated by another game, and I&#8217;m starting to think that it won&#8217;t ever be. Second Life never had the depth of interaction. Habbo Hotel never had the sense of reality. It&#8217;s a product of its time, a piece of history that deserves to be preserved for as long as possible. FreeSO is our attempt at doing that, though it has its limits as a reimplementation. While adding new things lets us envision a future TSO never had, it&#8217;s limited by our own interpretation of the original formula. Maybe one day, there should be a decompilation project to ensure that the true original is preserved too.</p><p>For me, FreeSO was an opportunity to fully explore a game that I never had the opportunity to play during its heyday. My only experience with The Sims Online was downloading the trial when I was too young to play, then eventually rediscovering and binging it weeks before the announcement of its shutdown. Its lasting impression was strong enough to drive me to dedicate years to the project, which I don&#8217;t think any other piece of media could have managed. Thanks to The Sims Online, I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to learn how my favourite game series works behind the scenes, and I love every piece of it.</p><p>While I never got to experience the &#8220;core gameplay&#8221; with FreeSO, I got something a lot better. I hung out on lot servers hosted by friends between developing new features before we even launched, messing around on a half-broken game. I looked forward to events with brand new objects created by the most talented people I know. Each and every time, I remember it as if I were there in person. No wonder the community lay dormant for 10 years, if moments in the game were this unforgettable.</p><p>I hope that we&#8217;ve been able to rekindle some of that spirit for you, too. Thanks for making the game the best it can be. If you log in from any point from now until the end of the year, you&#8217;ll receive a Simmy to celebrate.</p><p>Rhys</p><p><a href="http://freeso.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/wallpaper.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="822" data-permalink="http://freeso.org/20-years-of-the-sims-online/wallpaper/" data-orig-file="http://freeso.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/wallpaper.jpg" data-orig-size="1600,1175" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="wallpaper" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="http://freeso.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/wallpaper.jpg" data-large-file="http://freeso.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/wallpaper.jpg" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-822" src="http://freeso.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/wallpaper.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1175" /></a></p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://freeso.org/20-years-of-the-sims-online/">20 Years of The Sims Online</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://freeso.org">FreeSO</a>.</p>

				<![CDATA[<p>The FreeSO Team have been in extended discussions with the official regulators and governing body that controls April Fools and all Pranks and Tricks planned globally, and we have come to agreement. <strong>This Cannot Continue.</strong></p><h2>April Fools is <em><strong>NO LONGER</strong></em> going to be on April 1st.</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After years of specifically developed, fully functional April Fools masterpieces, this year the vanilla, boring, single digit date simply does not match up to what we need out of it. It is inconvenient, barely misses a weekend, and has the audacity to take place when I&#8217;m nowhere near a desktop computer. Plus, we&#8217;re no stranger to delaying events with supposedly &#8220;fixed&#8221; dates. Halloween, maybe even Christmas? No problem for us &#8211; how would this be any different?</p><p><strong>To rectify this problem, we have selected a new OFFICIAL date for 2022&#8217;s April Fools.</strong> The date is&#8230;</p><h1>Saturday 16th April 2022</h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Think about it. It&#8217;s perfect.

I mean, whatever wonderful, original idea we have planned.</p><p>The only downside is that the date is nowhere near as memorable. Of course, we have all bases covered &#8211; our masterful team of PR wizards have come up with this catchy and unique slogan which will make it easy for everyone to remember and understand the revised date for all April Fools antics:</p><h1>&#8220;Remember, Remember, the 16th of April&#8221;</h1><p><a href="http://freeso.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/april-16-2022.png"><img data-attachment-id="742" data-permalink="http://freeso.org/important-announcement-from-the-global-april-fools-committee/april-16-2022/" data-orig-file="http://freeso.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/april-16-2022.png" data-orig-size="280,252" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="april-16-2022" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="http://freeso.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/april-16-2022.png" data-large-file="http://freeso.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/april-16-2022.png" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-742" src="http://freeso.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/april-16-2022.png" alt="" width="280" height="252" /></a></p><p>Make sure that when anyone asks you <em>&#8220;what happened to april fools&#8221;</em>, <em>&#8220;download among us google play&#8221;</em>, or really, any message containing the word <em>&#8220;april&#8221;</em>, respond with our slogan _to the letter_ and all worries will be resolved.</p><p><strong>The following events will NOT occur today, as April 1st is <em>NO LONGER</em> the official active date for the April Fools holiday:</strong></p><ul><li>Fire and Fire spread active throughout Sunrise Crater.</li><li>Spicy Pizza Roulette, whatever that was meant to be.</li><li>Emoji Only Chat enabled on every second odd hour (UTC) throughout the day.</li><li>AmongSO Tournament at 8pm UTC at The Skeld (CANCELLED)</li><li>A &#8220;stress test&#8221; involving 2000 rugs, a ball pit and a malfunctioning pool filter at 7:23pm UTC (42 seconds)</li><li>[REDACTED]</li></ul><p>Do NOT hold any pranks on April 1st against this ruling.

				<![CDATA[<h3>The fifth Annual FreeSO Awards (AFA) Ceremony is finally here!</h3><p>Our beloved S1ndle was trying to dust off the trophies a few weeks ago, when he slipped in a puddle that someone left by the bookshelves and fell. All the trophies were smashed to bits! He&#8217;s spent the last few weeks trying to glue them back together. But try as he might, he just wasn&#8217;t able to get them quite right.</p><p>A total of <strong>13 unique awards</strong> are split into two categories:</p><ul><li>Players: Awards for diverse and eccentric personalities of FreeSO players.</li><li>Lots: Awards for iconic builds and magnificent designs in Sunrise Crater.</li></ul><p>Please keep in mind that you must be nominated for an award in order to win it.</p><p>Additionally, MOMI/DADDI/COUSINs, admins, and their lots are ineligible to win awards. This restriction does not include mentors. A player’s account must be in good standing to receive an award.</p><p>You can nominate/vote for other players on the following page: <a class="anchor-1MIwyf anchorUnderlineOnHover-2qPutX" tabindex="0" title="https://awards.freeso.org/" role="button" href="https://awards.freeso.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://awards.freeso.org/</a></p><h2>Instructions:</h2><p>Click anywhere on the page to open the voting box, choose a category to view its description, and then type in a Sim’s in-game name (not case sensitive) with an optional reason for why you voted for them. Don’t forget to press the vote button!</p><p>You’ll need to log in with your FreeSO account to be able to vote. You may only vote for each category once per account and per real life household (so if your family members also play, it may be a good idea to consider your nomination choices as a team).</p><p><strong>Voting ends on March 4th at 20:00 UTC</strong>, so get your nominations in and we hope you&#8217;ll join us at the <strong>Sunrise Crater Town Hall for the awards ceremony on</strong><strong>Saturday, March 5th at 20:00 UTC</strong>!</p><h1></h1><h1>The Categories</h1><p><strong> Individual Award Categories are:</strong></p><ul><li><em>Host/Hostess with the most-es</em> &#8211; For the Sim who always knows how to make you feel right at home</li><li><em>Best Roomie</em> &#8211; For the Sim stuck paying all the bills, cooking all the meals, and cleaning up after you</li><li><em>Master of Ceremonies</em> &#8211; For the Sim who goes above and beyond to organize the most unique/creative in-game events</li><li><em>Captain Creativity</em> &#8211; For Sunrise Crater’s artist-in-residence who partakes in game related arts such as sculpture, photography, cinematography, or 3d rendering</li><li><em>Most Iconic</em> &#8211; For the Sim who sets the trends and who is highly influential in Sunrise Crater</li><li><em>2 Sassy 4 U</em> &#8211; For the Sim who exceeds all levels of bodacious in the way that they act around town</li><li><em>Online 24/7</em> &#8211; For the Sim that never seems to disappear, because&#8230; SLEEP IS FOR THE WEAK</li><li><em>Prop Prepared</em> &#8211; For the Sim who’s always digging in the costume trunks and chests</li></ul><h3><strong> Lot Categories are:</strong></h3><ul><li><em>The Showperson&#8217;s Sleight of Hand Lot</em> &#8211; For the owner of the best entertainment or games lot</li><li><em>The Capitalism Cup Lot</em> &#8211; For the owner of the best money, skill, or shopping lot</li><li><em>The Hosting Helpers Lot</em> &#8211; For the owner of the best welcome or service lot</li><li><em>The Homebodies Lot</em> &#8211; For the owner of the best residential, romance, or offbeat lot</li><li><em>Best Lot Design</em> &#8211; For the owner of the best designed lot</li></ul><p><a href="http://freeso.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/rhysiefooter.png"><img data-attachment-id="729" data-permalink="http://freeso.org/721-2/rhysiefooter/" data-orig-file="http://freeso.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/rhysiefooter.png" data-orig-size="1394,1077" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="rhysiefooter" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="http://freeso.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/rhysiefooter.png" data-large-file="http://freeso.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/rhysiefooter.png" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-729" src="http://freeso.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/rhysiefooter.png" alt="" width="1394" height="1077" /></a></p><p>Best of luck to you all!<br />

				<![CDATA[<p>As many of you have already noticed, the Halloween season has already begun with trick-or-treating from door to door and zombie summoning, as well as sneaky SURPRISE zombies! At Sunrise Crater Town Hall, a mysterious traveling merchant has set up a prize booth. He claims to have rare items that he has collected from around the world to trade for candy (and he’ll need a dentist soon, because you guys are very skilled at collecting lots of candy.) He can also tell you about different ways to acquire candy, and has three new items for you to purchase!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Souls on the Loose</h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rumor on the streets of Sunrise Crater is that a rather frightening yet noteworthy character is passing through town to see their favorite band on tour! Death in the flesh (well, minus the flesh) accompanied by an incompetent yet seemingly knowledgeable intern is reported to have been seen at the <strong>Sunrise Crater Town Hall</strong>. However, it appears that there&#8217;s a bit of a mess in need of being sorted out. The Grim Reaper&#8217;s hefty Jar of Immortal Souls was clumsily dropped and shattered, allowing a flock of rampant souls to escape and hide throughout Sunrise Crater&#8217;s many neighborhoods!</p><p>Over the course of Saturday <strong>(October 30)</strong>, <strong>Sunday (October 31)</strong>, and <strong>Monday (November 1)</strong>, a series of daily scavenger hunts will take place and your riddle solving abilities will be put to the test. You will need to decode daily sets of clues in order to locate the souls. Each day, the first daily clue will be sent to you as a message via your in-game mailbox. Successfully locating souls will unlock the next clue with a total of <strong>9 per day</strong>. After you&#8217;ve collected all souls for the day, the Grim Reaper will be waiting for you to hand them over. Expect repayment in the form of various and bountiful offerings.</p><p>Don&#8217;t miss out, and put some work into decoding those clues before it&#8217;s too late!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>The Haunted Asylum</h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img class="transparent" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/193051988756398080/903210842445725696/teaserpic.png" alt="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/193051988756398080/903210842445725696/teaserpic.png" /></p><p>Many years ago, in Journey’s End, an Asylum was closed immediately due to the rapid spread of a deadly disease. The residents were left behind as a measure of quarantine. Try as they might to survive, they weren&#8217;t able to get out because doors are locked with secret codes. Lacking food and basic necessities while they were trapped, they eventually perished, and now haunt the Asylum forever.</p><p>The spirits are so angry about their demise, they&#8217;ve placed traps throughout the facility, in hopes to keep you there forever. A few even manifest a physical presence in order to activate some of the traps.</p><p>If you think you can survive the Haunted Escape Asylum, the spirits will be waiting for you.</p><p>There are a few items left lying around the Asylum that could give you a bit of respite along your journey, but they will be little comfort to you. Comfort and luxury are not on the menu here. Should you choose to enter this place, beware! You may not make it out with your sanity, thus making you another member of the Haunted Asylum. Taking the easy way, will not necessarily be beneficial, you could find yourself in more danger this way. Should you actually manage to escape, legend has it that the spirits store their valuables in the Dining Hall just as you leave. Will you be able to Escape?</p><p><img class="transparent" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/193051988756398080/903091643710840862/spookycollage.png" alt="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/193051988756398080/903091643710840862/spookycollage.png" /></p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://freeso.org/grim-happenings/">Grim Happenings</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://freeso.org">FreeSO</a>.</p>

				<![CDATA[<h2>Attention Sunrise Crater citizens!</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As stated in the last emergency alert, our weather forecast radar has been detecting signs of a potential monsoon with waves of strong winds, heavy rainfall, and thunder and lightning. This is an expected phenomenon which can occur with the change of season. However, this time our team of experts found some unusual signs that have never been recorded before. The rain water seems to have a higher level of fructose, making it heavier, stickier, and sweeter than your average rain. The winds are also carrying some sort of pink-ish powder that is creating the effect of a pink smog permeating the skies.</p><p>We hope you all had enough time to prepare and ready yourselves for the storm&#8217;s strongest impact. Please stay calm, take a deep breath, and have a toothbrush on hand at all times. Have some self control, and try not to bite!</p><div style="width: 640px;" class="wp-video">

			<h1>Sweet Prizes!</h1>
			<p>If you do find yourself unable to resist the temptation, you might end up face to face with the brand new addition to FreeSO seasonal shenanigans, the Lucky &#8216;Gumball&#8217; Machine!</p>
			<p>
				<img loading="lazy" class="shrinkToFit" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/193051988756398080/886631522130608178/fso-summer-leaflet.png" alt="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/193051988756398080/886631522130608178/fso-summer-leaflet.png" width="733" height="955" />
			</p>
			<p>The machine is available exclusively at Fructose Monsoon, our brand new event lot, but how does it work? Each gumball includes 1 mystery item from the 12-pack 2021 Summer Collection and a special bonus item for the price of only 800 Simoleons. What a steal! Come over and get yourself a box or&#8230; more! Please be assured that this machine will never go out of stock, but your wallet may!</p>
			<p>The launcher also seems to have been affected &#8211; we&#8217;re detecting an increase in its sugar content of around 2000% per pixel. We&#8217;re not sure what the 
				<em>normal</em> sugar content of a pixel is, but the dramatic increase is a cause for worry.
			</p>
			<p>It looks like the storm will be lasting until the end of October, so you&#8217;ve got plenty of time to make the most of it. Until then, enjoy yourselves, and maybe triple the frequency of your dentist appointments.</p>

				<![CDATA[<p>Games have changed over the last year. Mario is Dead, Cyberpunk is only 56 years away, and nobody cares about Fortnite anymore. The Sims Online isn&#8217;t competitive enough, violent enough, and our drama isn&#8217;t explosive enough to reach any social media feed. We need to adapt to a changing market, and the best way to do that is to shamelessly rip off the most popular game at the time.</p><p>Introducing <strong>AmongSO</strong>, the first in a series of exciting and original game modes featuring characters without any arms. Why play the real thing on balanced, well thought out maps when you just aimlessly float around properties in FreeSO instead? Yes, you heard me right, every property in FreeSO is the playing ground for AmongSO. Who needs tasks, when you can make group meals as a crewmate? For maximum frustration, the game starts randomly every 20-40 minutes, so that you never truly feel safe.</p><p>Kill your friends, vote out the wrong person, this is just the future of social interaction. We are living it.</p><p>If you win a game, you have a chance of winning a coveted <strong>C Sus2 Music Box</strong> &#8211; a programmable music box that plays everyone&#8217;s favourite music remix by default, but can be programmed to play anything you want. Available today only!</p><p><a href="http://freeso.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/inshot.png"><img data-attachment-id="683" data-permalink="http://freeso.org/when-freeso-is-sus/inshot/" data-orig-file="http://freeso.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/inshot.png" data-orig-size="787,535" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="inshot" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="http://freeso.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/inshot.png" data-large-file="http://freeso.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/inshot.png" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-683" src="http://freeso.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/inshot.png" alt="" width="787" height="535" /></a><br />

Why does everything feel like it was designed 17 years ago? Well, apart from the fact that it was, we decided that enough was enough and it was time to bring the game into the modern era ourselves.</p><p>We&#8217;ve heard complaints that the motive system is too &#8220;antiquated&#8221; and &#8220;boring&#8221;, and we heard you <strong>LOUD AND CLEAR</strong>. When you get ingame, you&#8217;ll see a whole new system awaiting you &#8211; you&#8217;ll find everything has been flipped on its head! As all good UX designers say: completely switch up the meaning and layout of everything, and your users will be more &#8220;engaged&#8221;. <img class="emoji" draggable="false" src="https://ptb.discordapp.com/assets/817f965bd1fd796777908e6c8052d665.svg" alt=":relieved:" aria-label=":relieved:" /></p></div><div></div><div class="markup-2BOw-j messageContent-2qWWxC">To spice up your lives a little, we have added fire to the game for the first time! Yep, definitely haven&#8217;t done this one before. If you&#8217;re having trouble getting a tan these days, imagine what standing on a rug can do for you in FreeSO.</div><div></div><div class="markup-2BOw-j messageContent-2qWWxC">Doritos have done it, Nandos have done it, now we&#8217;re doing it too. You can order a new type of pizza via the phone: &#8220;Pizza Roulette&#8221;! Will it be ice cold? Will it be hot and spicy? There&#8217;s only one way to find out! This is a great, original new idea that is definitely new this year and will never come around again. No siree.</div><div></div><div class="markup-2BOw-j messageContent-2qWWxC">We are now building the game on Azure Pipelines! That&#8217;s not a feature, I just wanted to mention it somewhere.</div><div></div><div class="markup-2BOw-j messageContent-2qWWxC">Ever felt that outfits in TSO are too &#8220;grounded&#8221; for your tastes? Who wants to still be in their pajamas when they get out of bed? Nobody wants to be reminded of the tortures of real life, so we&#8217;ve added a convenience feature that can switch you into your desired outfit without any user input. How does the game know what your desired outfit is? That information has been patented &#8211; sorry.<i class="separator-2nZzUB" aria-hidden="true"></i></div><div></div></div></div><div class="message-2qnXI6 cozyMessage-3V1Y8y wrapper-2a6GCs cozy-3raOZG zalgo-jN1Ica"><div class="contents-2mQqc9"><div class="markup-2BOw-j messageContent-2qWWxC">We&#8217;ve also added more hats to the game! That&#8217;s really all there is to say on the matter. <img class="emoji" draggable="false" src="https://ptb.discordapp.com/assets/31123922fb35c46cb2f8daa1cf4899a5.svg" alt=":tophat:" aria-label=":tophat:" /></div><div></div><div class="markup-2BOw-j messageContent-2qWWxC"><img class="transparent" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/193181767585366017/694790252010799104/unknown.png" alt="unknown.png" /></div><div></div><div class="markup-2BOw-j messageContent-2qWWxC">And finally, you read it above, we&#8217;ve added one of the most desired objects to the game. An experience that before you could only get via custom content or shady ass servers running 10 year old game versions. It&#8217;s here, it&#8217;s OFFICIAL. Love it, run to it, destiny arrives all the same.</div><div><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/193181767585366017/694760595710279680/ripkitchen.png" alt="ripkitchen.png" /></div><h2 class="markup-2BOw-j messageContent-2qWWxC"><strong><strong>Log in today only to receive your prize!</strong></strong></h2></div></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://freeso.org/freeso-a-residence-reborn/">FreeSO: A Residence Reborn</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://freeso.org">FreeSO</a>.</p>
